# school-scheduler
School scheduler is supposed to be a tool that makes life easier in lower-educational institutions. It shall provide services in class-scheduling, student-teacher communication, curriculum accessibility. Secondary goal is to demonstrate my skills with different programming languages and technologies.
According to the actual plan, the full-bore scheduler will be consisted of 4 different modules. 
A core module written in python, that implements the main business logic: a genetic algorithm that generates a schedule matching to the input constraints.
An api-gateway module that provides the connection between the core module, the online DB, and the UIs. This module shall demonstrate my Spring skills.
